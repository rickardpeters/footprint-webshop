# Footpring webshop

For my bachelor's project at the end of my 3rd year of university, me and a group of other students created an e-commerce website to investigate how the choice of color on a website affects the perceived trustworthiness.

Frontend was created using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Backend was created using Python Flask.

A web pay solution was implemented using Stripe.
